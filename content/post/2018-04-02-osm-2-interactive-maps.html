<h2>Introducing the leaflet package</h2>
<p>Plain images of map data is so web 1.0. R htmlwidgets mean I don’t have to acttuully learn Javascript to mess around with Javascript libraries in this site. One of the flagship examples <a href="http://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/">leaflet</a> works with OSM out of the box.</p>
<p>Last time I wrote a file containing name and distance of my coffee shops. I now need to run that script again so I can get longitude and latitude. Let’s load it into a data frame and plot it.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>coffee &lt;- read_csv(here(&quot;static&quot;,&quot;data&quot;, &quot;OSM&quot;, &quot;QH coffee.csv&quot;)) %&gt;%
  mutate(`walking distance`  = round(`walking distance`) )

coffee_icon &lt;- makeIcon(&quot;../img/coffee-cup.svg&quot;,   iconWidth = 38, iconHeight = 95,
  iconAnchorX = 22, iconAnchorY = 94)

m &lt;- leaflet(data=coffee) %&gt;%
    addMarkers(~longitude, ~latitude, popup = ~as.character(`walking distance`), label = ~as.character(name), icon=coffee_icon) %&gt;%
  addTiles()
m</code></pre>

<p>Given that the map includes the actual location of the coffee shop, not just the nearest node on the graph, I can see where errors have happened. In particular, There also seem to be a few that are totally in walking distance, but aren’t marked on my map.</p>
<p>However, my processing of the OSM data for points of interest is terrible, and I’ve learned to start reading fork data on GitHub. There’s a pending change to osmnx where you’ll be able to select points of interest in a much more elegant way than I’ve done.</p>
<p>I’m looking at modifying how it loads OSM format XML files, because I want to make <em>large</em> road maps. Currently it loads the entire dump to memory, and only then starts filtering out what it doesn’t need. I want to read one element at a time and decide if it is worth keeping or not, like I did above.</p>
<p>But this is much more elegant than my flat images. I can actually include both the name and the distance in the graph. (Yes, a map can be a graph.) Also, the leaflet package is seriously painless.</p>
<p>So there’s probably not going to be many blog posts on this in the near future as I update some of the backend.</p>
<p>If I were running Shiny, I could let you input a location and a walking distance and it would update the map. I don’t have Shiny. I’ll take requests for additional maps. Give me a location, and some combination of points of interest from <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tags">the OSM Wiki</a>.</p>
