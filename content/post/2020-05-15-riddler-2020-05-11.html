<p>Two things are guaranteed to grab my attention in a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/can-you-find-the-best-dungeons-dragons-strategy/">Riddler Column</a> - Dungeons and Dragons (DnD) and probability spaces small enough to enumerate all combinations.</p>
<p>The default position is roll 1 20-sided die (d20), and the other scenarios involve 4 d20 rolls, with a probability space of 20^4= 160,000. More than Iâ€™m willing to do by hand, but R laughs at how easy this is.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>
die &lt;- 1:20
all_combinations &lt;- list(die_1 = die,die_2=die,die_3=die,die_4=die) %&gt;% 
  cross_df()</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>result_table &lt;- all_combinations %&gt;% 
  mutate(advantage_1 = pmax(die_1,die_2), advantage_2 = pmax(die_3,die_4),
         dis_1 = pmin(die_1,die_2), dis_2=pmin(die_3,die_4)) %&gt;% 
  mutate(dis_of_advantage = pmin(advantage_1, advantage_2),
         advantage_of_dis = pmax(dis_1,dis_2)) </code></pre>
<p>Then the average for each is:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>result_table %&gt;% 
  summarise(default = mean(die_1),
            dis_of_advantage = mean(dis_of_advantage),
            advantage_of_dis = mean(advantage_of_dis)) %&gt;% 
  knitr::kable()</code></pre>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th align="right">default</th>
<th align="right">dis_of_advantage</th>
<th align="right">advantage_of_dis</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="right">10.5</td>
<td align="right">11.16666</td>
<td align="right">9.833338</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>So disadvantage of advantage is better than default, which is better than advantage of disadvantage. On average.</p>
<p>The probability of getting exactly each roll is:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>result_table %&gt;% 
  select(die_1, dis_of_advantage, advantage_of_dis) %&gt;% 
  pivot_longer(1:3) %&gt;% 
  count(name,value) %&gt;% 
  group_by(name) %&gt;% 
  mutate(p=n/sum(n)) %&gt;% 
  ungroup() %&gt;% 
  ggplot(aes(x=value,y=p,colour=name)) + geom_line() +
  scale_y_continuous(labels=scales::percent) +
  expand_limits(y=0) +
  theme_minimal()</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2020-05-15-riddler-2020-05-11_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Or the probability of getting <em>at least</em> N on the roll is:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>result_table %&gt;% 
  select(die_1, dis_of_advantage, advantage_of_dis) %&gt;% 
  pivot_longer(1:3) %&gt;% 
  count(name,value) %&gt;% 
  group_by(name) %&gt;% 
  mutate(p=n/sum(n)) %&gt;% 
  arrange(-value) %&gt;% 
  mutate(p=cumsum(p)) %&gt;% 
  ungroup() %&gt;% 
  plot_ly(x=~value,y=~p,split=~name) %&gt;% 
  add_lines() %&gt;% 
          layout(yaxis = list(tickformat = &quot;%&quot;))</code></pre>
