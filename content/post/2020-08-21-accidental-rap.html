<p>I have this pipeline of data - I do a workout, record bits as I go along, log it on Fitocracy…</p>
<p>Fito haven’t added any features in years, in fact they’re barely keeping the server running at this point.</p>
<p>So I grabbed <a href="https://github.com/luketurner/fitocracy-export">this script</a> that asks the server for all my workout data, which arrives as a giant blob of JSON.</p>
<p>The data on my machine doesn’t need to be the most timely, so I have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron">cron</a> run that script 1ce a day. <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>There’s interviews with the founders of Fitocracy that showed that they distrusted libraries and wanted to code everything from scratch. This really shows in the JSON that the server spits out. I have this little script that converts that JSON into a CSV:</p>
<p>Honestly, the heavy lifting is done by the <code>jsonlite</code> package. The rest is a bit of <code>purrr</code> going up and down the list of lists of lists and keeping only the useful stuff.</p>
<p>Now I have a (massive) csv that’s accurate up to midnight last night. Then the below dashboard sort of grew out of that.</p>
<p>It wasn’t until someone gave a presentation on Reproducible Analytical Pipelines (RAP) that I realised I’d built one just trying to motivate myself to keep lifting heavy stuff.</p>

<p>The programs I’ve been working with while running these scripts have focused on pressing things overhead, pressing on a bench, squatting and deadlifting, so that’s why those ones get more attention.</p>
<p>I came across Stronger By Science’s <a href="https://www.strongerbyscience.com/art-and-science/">Art &amp; Science of Lifting</a> which confirmed that (as long as the weight isn’t too light) the better workout is generally the one with more volume - the repetitions (reps) times the weight. So I started graphing volume.</p>
<p>The heatmaps of volume for those lifts are kinda inspired by GitHub’s activity graphs.</p>
<p>I installed the <code>ggalt</code> package just so I could draw dumbbell graphs.</p>

<h2>Further work</h2>
<p>The dashboard gets tweaked fairly often, sometimes adding a table/removing a graph/changing a colour scheme.</p>
<p>Blogging about how I accidentally built a RAP has been on the TODO list for a while…</p>
<p>I want my nightly cron script to pin the latest data with the pins package, which I’ll do by tweaking the json-&gt;csv part of the pipeline.</p>
