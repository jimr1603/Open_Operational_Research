<h1>The world is not as it seems…</h1>
<p>Niantic (of Pokemon Go and Harry Potter Wizards Unite) have <a href="https://ingress.com/">Ingress</a> as their first game. Gameplay is very basic compared to the other games, which goes a long way to explaining why I put Ingress down for a long time when Pokemon Go started.</p>
<p>I’ve hit a slump in Po Go, and picked Ingress back up. I might come back and talk about the lore, but for the purposes of this post:</p>
<ul>
<li>The ‘Shapers’ are pan-dimensional beings that throw ‘exotic matter’ into our universe through portals, and we react to this by bulding points of interest there.</li>
<li>The green team (Enlightened) believe that the Shapers want to be our friends.</li>
<li>The blue team (Resistance) believe that the Shapers are sinister.</li>
<li>We play the game by physically walking to a portal and interacting with it on our phones.</li>
<li>There’s a minigame that’s approximately Simon Says with alien glyphs that make certain messages.</li>
</ul>
<p>I’m trying to get better at remembering the glyphs, so I’ve been looking up lists of glyphs and stuff. <a href="http://gm9.github.io/ingress-glyph-tools/">This Javascript example</a> has been handy, but I’ve got a few ideas floating around for playing with glyphs, and a whole bunch of them rely on a sensible glyph package. I grabbed their JS encoding of the glyphs, it needs a bit more cleanup before I’d call it a final version, but it’ll work for today.</p>
<p>Also, Hadley is an</p>

<p>Unusually for me, most of the actual code for this post is tucked away somewhere else, since I put a basic version of GliphR together today - <a href="https://github.com/jimr1603/GlyphR">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>I’m finding problems as I’m trying to use the library, and adding them to my <a href="https://github.com/jimr1603/GlyphR/issues">GitHub Issues</a> as I go. It’s a nice way of dealing with stuff.</p>

<p>Those are ggplots/tidygraphs, I can play with how they’re displayed.</p>

<p>Yes, I deliberately made the ugliest graph I could.</p>
