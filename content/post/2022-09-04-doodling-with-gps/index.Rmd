```

Some days you want to do serious analysis, some days you want to make rude drawings on GPS traces with your bike:

```{r}
data = jsonlite::fromJSON("~/Nextcloud/Health and Fitness/GoldenCheetah/James Riley/activities/2022_08_22_19_37_53.json")
data = pluck(data, "RIDE", "SAMPLES")
```

```{r}
data %>% 
  filter(LAT != 0, LON != 0) %>% 
  select(SECS, LAT, LON) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  st_as_sf(coords = c("lat", "lon"), crs = "EPSG:4326") %>% 
  st_normalize() %>% 
  ggplot(aes(geometry = geometry)) + stat_sf_coordinates()
```
