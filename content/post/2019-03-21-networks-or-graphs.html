<p>With thanks to <a href="http://kateto.net/netscix2016">this tutorial on network analysis in R</a>
I’ve not followed all the suggestions, but it’s been a good springboard.</p>
<div id="intro" class="section level2">
<h2>Intro</h2>
<p>Looks like I’m going to sometimes use tidygraph, sometimes go down one level and go to igraph as necessary.</p>
<p>Graph Theory (as I was taught it), or Network Theory (which makes googling it easier because there’s something else called a graph) is a nice bit of Discrete Maths. It opens with Euler trying to walk across all these bridges exactly once:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>tribble(
  ~from, ~to,
  &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;,
  &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;,
  &quot;a&quot;, &quot;c&quot;,
  &quot;a&quot;, &quot;c&quot;,
  &quot;a&quot;, &quot;d&quot;,
  &quot;b&quot;, &quot;d&quot;,
  &quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot;
) %&gt;%
as_tbl_graph(directed=FALSE) %&gt;%
  plot()</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2019-03-21-networks-or-graphs_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Which finds its way into general usage as “draw that figure without taking your pen off the paper”. (Or punching a hole in the paper, or folding the paper over to extend…)</p>
<p>That one can’t be done. Neither can these:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>make_full_bipartite_graph(3,3) %&gt;%
  plot(layout=layout_as_bipartite)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2019-03-21-networks-or-graphs_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<pre class="r"><code>make_full_graph(5) %&gt;%
  plot()</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2019-03-21-networks-or-graphs_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" width="672" /></p>
</div>
<div id="rock-paper-scissors-psychic-dark" class="section level2">
<h2>Rock-Paper-Scissors-Psychic-Dark</h2>
<p>All you need for a network is some objects and some relationship between them. If your relationship is “wins against” then rock-paper-scissors looks like:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>tribble(
  ~from, ~to,
  &quot;rock&quot;, &quot;scissors&quot;,
  &quot;scissors&quot;, &quot;paper&quot;,
  &quot;paper&quot;, &quot;rock&quot;
) %&gt;%
  as_tbl_graph() %&gt;%
  plot(vertex.shape=&quot;none&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2019-03-21-networks-or-graphs_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Which shows the symmetry and ‘fairness’ in RPS quite nicely. Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock and a multitude of more have similar shapes.</p>
<p>Pokemon has a similar thing, but not the same symmetries. I’m going to focus on Pokemon-Go, because that’s what I’m currently playing.</p>
<p>Pokemon has normal damage, super-effective, not very effective, and immune. Go has implemented “immune” as not very effective 2ce, rather than actual immunity. The below shows these with different coloured arrows.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>
pogo_type_effectiveness &lt;- read_csv(here(&quot;static&quot;, &quot;data&quot;, &quot;PoGo&quot;, &quot;type_effectiveness.csv&quot;)) %&gt;%
  rename(from=X1) %&gt;%
  gather(to, value, -from)

pogo_graph &lt;- pogo_type_effectiveness %&gt;%
  filter(!is.na(value)) %&gt;%
  mutate(game_text = case_when(
    value&lt;0.6 ~ &quot;Immune&quot;,
    value &lt; 1 ~ &quot;Not very effective&quot;,
    TRUE ~ &quot;Super-effective&quot;
  )) %&gt;%
  mutate(color = case_when(
    value&lt;0.6 ~ &quot;maroon&quot;,
    value &lt; 1 ~ &quot;red&quot;,
    TRUE ~ &quot;green&quot;
  )) %&gt;%
  as_tbl_graph() 

plot(pogo_graph, edge.color = E(pogo_graph)$color, layout=layout_in_circle, vertex.shape = &quot;none&quot;, edge.arrow.size=0.3, edge.curved=0.1)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2019-03-21-networks-or-graphs_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>This is absolutely a hairball graph!</p>
<p>Throwing tidygraph at it, I can filter out just the super effective, or the not very effective:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>
pogo_graph %&gt;%
  activate(edges) %&gt;%
  filter(color==&quot;green&quot;) %&gt;%
  plot(edge.color=&quot;green&quot;, layout=layout_in_circle, vertex.shape = &quot;none&quot;, edge.arrow.size=0.3, edge.curved=0.1)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2019-03-21-networks-or-graphs_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<pre class="r"><code>
pogo_graph %&gt;%
  activate(edges) %&gt;%
  filter(color==&quot;red&quot;) %&gt;%
  plot(edge.color=&quot;red&quot;, layout=layout_in_circle, vertex.shape = &quot;none&quot;, edge.arrow.size=0.3, edge.curved=0.1)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2019-03-21-networks-or-graphs_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>For the <a href="https://silph.gg/tempest-cup">temptest cup</a></p>
<pre class="r"><code>pogo_graph %&gt;%
  activate(nodes) %&gt;%
  filter(name %in% c(&quot;Electric&quot;, &quot;Ice&quot;, &quot;Flying&quot;, &quot;Ground&quot;)) %&gt;%
  plot(layout=layout_in_circle, vertex.shape = &quot;none&quot;, edge.arrow.size=0.3, edge.curved=0.1)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2019-03-21-networks-or-graphs_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png" width="672" /></p>

<p>These are all static graphs, we’re online and we have JavaScript.</p>
<p>Using visNetwork:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>nodes &lt;- tibble(id = unique(pogo_type_effectiveness$from),
                label=id)

edges &lt;- pogo_type_effectiveness %&gt;%
  filter(!is.na(value)) %&gt;%
  mutate(color = case_when(
    value&lt;0.6 ~ &quot;maroon&quot;,
    value &lt; 1 ~ &quot;red&quot;,
    TRUE ~ &quot;green&quot;
  )) %&gt;%
  mutate(arrows=&quot;to&quot;) %&gt;%
  select(-value)

visNetwork(nodes, edges) %&gt;%
  visInteraction(navigationButtons = TRUE)</code></pre>

<p>You can move this one around!</p>
<p>Or in networkD3:</p>
<p>No. I didn’t get networkD3 working.</p>

<div id="collatz-conjecture" class="section level2">
<h2>Collatz Conjecture</h2>
<p>XKCD references the Collatz Conjecture:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/collatz_conjecture.png" alt="Collatz Conjecture" />
<p class="caption">Collatz Conjecture</p>
</div>
<p>and it makes me think every time I wear the shirt of it. Both the comic and the shirt have a directed graph, so let’s have a play.</p>
<p>First we need a function that takes an integer 2 or larger to the next number in the sequence. 1 can be the end of the sequence so I don’t get (directed) loops.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>collatz &lt;- function(n){
  stopifnot(n == round(n, 0), n&gt;1) #Type forcing means our integers might have become floats.
  
  case_when(
    n %% 2 == 0 ~ n/2,
    TRUE ~ 3*n+1
  )
}</code></pre>
<p>At this point I’ve discovered ggraph, so I’m doing different graphs to earlier.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>set_graph_style(plot_margin = margin(1,1,1,1))

collatz_graph &lt;- tibble(from=2:250, to=collatz(from)) %&gt;%
  as_tbl_graph() 

components &lt;- components(collatz_graph) #Try to keep only the ones who have already mapped to 1
component_1 &lt;- names(components$membership[components$membership==1] ) %&gt;%
  as.numeric()

collatz_graph %&gt;%
  activate(nodes) %&gt;%
  filter(name %in% component_1) %&gt;%
  ggraph() + geom_edge_link(arrow = arrow(length = unit(1, &#39;mm&#39;)), 
                  start_cap = circle(1, &#39;mm&#39;),
                  end_cap = circle(1, &#39;mm&#39;)) + geom_node_text(aes(label=name))</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2019-03-21-networks-or-graphs_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>This scales, but not well:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>
plot_collatz &lt;- function(upper_bound){
  collatz_graph &lt;- tibble(from=2:upper_bound, to=collatz(from)) %&gt;%
    as_tbl_graph() 
  
  components &lt;- components(collatz_graph) #Try to keep only the ones who have already mapped to 1
  component_1 &lt;- names(components$membership[components$membership==1] ) %&gt;%
    as.numeric()
  
  collatz_graph %&gt;%
    activate(nodes) %&gt;%
    filter(name %in% component_1) %&gt;%
    ggraph() + geom_edge_link(arrow = arrow(length = unit(1, &#39;mm&#39;)), 
                    start_cap = circle(1, &#39;mm&#39;),
                    end_cap = circle(1, &#39;mm&#39;)) + geom_node_text(aes(label=name))
