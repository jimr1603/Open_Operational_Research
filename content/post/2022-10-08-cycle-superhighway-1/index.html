<h1>Cycle Superhighway 1</h1>
<p>Sometimes analysis is gathering large amounts of data, building complex models, or sexy machine learning.</p>
<p>Sometimes analysis is quick and dirty, and just as effective.</p>
<p>This is part of the Leeds-Bradford Cycle Superhighway 1, and at this point it is about 2’ wide:</p>

<p>The name “Cycle Superhighway” suggests to me that it should be world-class infrastructure. “Superhighway” suggests it should be at least as good as a motorway, maybe even autobahn levels of quality.</p>
<p>In many segments CS1 falls short of these goals. This is the first I’m ranting about.</p>
<p>The lane generally shrinks this much, or worse, when it passes a bus shelter.
It forces cycle traffic into conflict with pedestrians, and people waiting for the bus.</p>
<p>This photo was a couple of weeks ago, I’ve had low motivation lately, but
if I went back now it’d be covered in wet leaves. So the clash is even more dangerous than normal.</p>
<p>On the plus side this is one of the rare points where they use a contrasting
colour to regular pavement to reinforce that it’s a segregated lane.</p>
<p>I cycle and also drive a car - as a car driver we’d be miffed if we got a
super-motorway that was as narrow as the vehicle in places.</p>
<p>Also, part of what makes motorways so safe is the segregation. Forcing bikes into
conflict with pedestrians (much slower) or cars (much faster) increases risk on both
sides.</p>

<p>In this case, they’ve struggled to squeeze a bus shelter and a segregated
bike line on the pavement. On the main road next to it is a 3-lane road with a
40 mph limit and spaces for police to sit in cars waiting for speeders.</p>
<p>There was a half-hearted attempt to make the leftmost lane a bus lane, I’d
strengthen it. Preferably to the level where at least the fast bus would
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQY6WGOoYis">not get stuck in traffic</a>.</p>
<p>Without measuring everything, and going OTT, the remaining
lanes could probably be narrowed, possibly reducing the limit if necessary.
Right now that street communicates that it’s a fast street, but if it were narrower
then it might better communicate that there’s driveways directly on it.</p>
<p>In this case there’s plenty of space for cycle and pedestrian/bus users, just
most of the space is taken up by cars with 1 or 2 people in them at peak hours.</p>
