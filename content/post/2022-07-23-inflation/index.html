<p>Inflation is a very hot topic right now. <a href="https://www.pcs.org.uk/news-events/news/insulting-public-sector-pay-offers-show-need-coordinate-action">Especially in the Civil Service where we face another real-terms pay cut.</a></p>
<p>I’d say 11 or 12+ years, but I’ve worked there for 5, so sufficient to say “longer than I’ve been there”.</p>
<p>I’ve been learning Javascript at Observable, and put together <a href="https://observablehq.com/@jimr1603/uk-cpih-inflation-calculator">this calculator</a> for demonstrating how much pay is down in real terms, for an individual.</p>
<p>It also should embed below.</p>

<p>The original dataset was massive, and it would be horribly antisocial to force the whole thing to load so I pre-processed it with this R script:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(&quot;tidyverse&quot;)
read_csv(&quot;mm23.csv&quot;,
         col_select = c(year = Title, CPIH=&quot;CPIH INDEX 00: ALL ITEMS 2015=100&quot;)) %&gt;% 
  as_tibble() %&gt;% 
  mutate(CPIH = as.numeric(CPIH)) %&gt;% 
  filter(!is.na(CPIH)) %&gt;% 
  arrange(-row_number()) %&gt;% 
  write_csv(&quot;cpih.csv&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>I thought this was going to end up being a pure JS post, but the R snuck in there!</p>
