Inflation is a very hot topic right now. [Especially in the Civil Service where we face another real-terms pay cut.](https://www.pcs.org.uk/news-events/news/insulting-public-sector-pay-offers-show-need-coordinate-action)

I'd say 11 or 12+ years, but I've worked there for 5, so sufficient to say "longer than I've been there". 

I've been learning Javascript at Observable, and put together [this calculator](https://observablehq.com/@jimr1603/uk-cpih-inflation-calculator) for demonstrating how much pay is down in real terms, for an individual. 

It also should embed below.

```

The original dataset was massive, and it would be horribly antisocial to force the whole thing to load so I pre-processed it with this R script:

```{r eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
library("tidyverse")
read_csv("mm23.csv",
         col_select = c(year = Title, CPIH="CPIH INDEX 00: ALL ITEMS 2015=100")) %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  mutate(CPIH = as.numeric(CPIH)) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(CPIH)) %>% 
  arrange(-row_number()) %>% 
  write_csv("cpih.csv")
```

I thought this was going to end up being a pure JS post, but the R snuck in there!
