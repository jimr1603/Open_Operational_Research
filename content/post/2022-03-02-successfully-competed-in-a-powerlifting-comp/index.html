<p>I’d be showing off some updates to {openpoweRlifting}, but:</p>
<ul>
<li>the epic csv downloads break the free tier of RStudio Cloud I’ve been playing with for overloading the RAM.</li>
<li>The home RStudio Server isn’t much better on RAM.</li>
<li>Batch processing it into a SQLite Database almost works.</li>
</ul>
<p>It turns out that in the actual server it’s 3 tables; meets, lifters and entries. The server internally produces 3 csvs for these and these might get exposed down the line. For today I built the server through docker, pulled out the csvs, and {pin}ned them.</p>
<p>There’s faster ways to get just the csvs, but I spent the time doing other stuff rather than working out how to make rust happen.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>board = board_local()
entries = pin_read(board, &quot;opl-entries&quot;)
lifters = pin_read(board, &quot;opl-lifters&quot;)
meets   = pin_read(board, &quot;opl-meets&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>I’m <a href="https://openpowerlifting.org/u/jamesriley7">James Riley #7</a>. My numbers aren’t brilliant, but a couple of years ago I was practically unable to walk from sciatica, so there’s a lot of progress from that low point.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.strongerbyscience.com/whos-the-most-impressive-powerlifter/">Stronger by Science have written about scaling by body weight</a>, that at least theoretically goes past human limits.</p>

<p>You may be asking if I’ve been waiting to use the Allometric Strength Score abbreviated as ‘ass’ because I’m that immature. On my days off, yes, I am. I’m also making it a ASS factor relative to my weight on comp day. That makes it easier to relate these numbers to my unmodified numbers.</p>
<p>And frankly, I’m somewhere around the 25% body fat level and would be generally in better health if it was 15% or lower. That puts me at least 1 weight category too high, but it was good to get the experience of comp before being in competitive shape.</p>
<p>We’ve been looking at the 7 degrees of separation graph in Powerlifting Meets on the OpenPowerlifting chat server.</p>
<p>With the entries/meets/lifters disambiguation I realised that it’s pretty easy to make a lifter is adjacent to a meet they’ve taken part in. Ordinary graph distance just needs halving then - the path from me to anyone else goes me -&gt; YNE spring open -&gt; someone else in the same comp. The distance we’re interested in is 1, the distance the graph says is 2.</p>
<p>Anyway, for the connected component I’m in, practically everyone is about 4 meets away. This makes sense - at a regional meet someone will qualify for nationals. At a national meet someone will qualify for continental, … worlds.</p>
