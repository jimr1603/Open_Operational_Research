<p>I have two-ish sensible routes on bike to/from work, depending on mood/weather/roadworks.
Except for the last mile.</p>
<p>Next time I’m in the office I’ll grab the GPS log, process it outside of here, and show
how the last mile <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> takes far too long.</p>
<p>Update: this happened:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ride = read_csv(&quot;data.csv&quot;) %&gt;% 
  mutate(secs = set_units(secs, &quot;seconds&quot;)) %&gt;% 
  mutate(dist = set_units(dist, &quot;meters&quot;)) %&gt;% 
  mutate(dist = set_units(dist, &quot;km&quot;)) %&gt;% 
  mutate(time = set_units(secs, &quot;minutes&quot;)) 

ride %&gt;% 
  ggplot(aes(x=time, y=dist)) + geom_point() +
    geom_smooth(method = &quot;lm&quot;) +
    expand_limits(x=60)</code></pre>
<p><img src="{{< blogdown/postref >}}index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p><code>dist</code> is distance as the crow flies from the target location. Different paths to work are different lengths, but I want to compare door-to-door time.</p>
<p>The gradient of that line corresponds to a sort of average useful speed - time spent going away from target is penalised, only movement towards the target counts. I kind-of want to throw some components together - compare crow-flying distance to work against my average bus of about 70 mins each way. But I suspect with a very large variance…</p>
<p>This means I can actually blog about this, since I’ve already given away enough info
for anyone to work out which office I’m at, but haven’t said where home is.</p>

<p>The title for today’s post derives from the crow-flying distance between those points:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>coordinates %&gt;% 
  st_as_sf(coords = c(&quot;lon&quot;, &quot;lat&quot;), crs = 4326) %&gt;% 
  st_distance() %&gt;% 
  knitr::kable()</code></pre>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="right">0.000 [m]</td>
<td align="right">1488.619 [m]</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="right">1488.619 [m]</td>
<td align="right">0.000 [m]</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>It’s a matrix of pairwise distances, but 1489m is close enough to 1 mile to make comparisons to “last mile” in shipping.</p>
<p>I tinkered with the <a href="https://github.com/chris31415926535/valhallr/pull/1">valhallr library last year</a> and still have a local Docker image of West Yorkshire set up for routing. Docker is great - I can tell the image to go to sleep when I’m not playing with it.</p>
<p>After the initial setup, which was basically feeding a bbox of limit coordinates into a config file, waiting about 1 afternoon for it to work out the network, this is by far the easiest roll-your-own routing engine I’ve played with.</p>
<p>Note - 1 way systems mean that point A -&gt; work is a different problem to work -&gt; point A.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>route_1 = route(coordinates[1,], coordinates[2,], costing=&quot;bicycle&quot;) 

route_2 = route(coordinates[2,], coordinates[1,], costing=&quot;bicycle&quot;)

<p>That looks much more sensible. However, I suspect that the OSM data that I fed into my valhalla server is way out of date, and the odd road might be shut for roadworks now.</p>
<p>Compare with <a href="https://www.cyclestreets.net/journey/79638854/">cyclestreets</a> there’s pretty good agreement. In the <a href="https://www.cyclestreets.net/journey/79638864/">return trip</a> it does believe in dismounting to cross awkward roads. I also really like the cycle-focused OSM tiles CS use - cycle paths, pubs and cafes are highlighted.</p>
<p>Both are better than what I tried the first time, which mostly involved getting stuck in the inner Leeds loop, roads/cycleways closed for roadworks, and random disappearing cycle paths.</p>
<p>I’ve played with the Google Maps routing service, but the programmers at Google seem to believe that any road that is bike-legal is fair game.</p>
