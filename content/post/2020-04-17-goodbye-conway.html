<p>The world has lost John Conway to covid-19. I recall my first interactions with Life - I had an offer to study undergrad maths at Cambridge. They recognised that folk from state schools were at a disadvantage to those from private schools for their own additional exam, so we got a crash course in the Easter holidays. Somehow Life came up in conversation with another student, and we ended up running the simulation with a deck of cards we had to hand, including moving a glider[^1] across the floor, one tick at a time.</p>
<p><a href="https://hackaday.com/tag/john-horton-conway/">Hackaday</a> challenged us to program Life in memorial, so here goes.</p>
<p>There was some <em>ugly</em> R code here that ran incredibly slowly. But then I’ve been reading <a href="https://eloquentjavascript.net/">Eloquent JavaScript</a> and <a href="">Plotly</a> was <em>designed</em> for JavaScript, so it wasn’t hard to go from plotting in R to plotting in JS.</p>

<p>A nice side-effect is that what you see above is uniquely running on your machine.</p>
