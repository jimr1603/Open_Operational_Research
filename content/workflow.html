<p>This is an ongoing scratchpad of what I have ideas for, what I’m working on, and what I just need to make presentable. There’s a massive difference between code I’m happy gives me an answer, and code I’m happy for someone else to see.</p>

<p>This was originally going to be a Trello. I’m probably going to need something that needs less maintenance than a raw markup file, probably something with vectors.</p>
<p>Now there’s a mildly ugly code in the background making a tibble with blanks. But at least it’s easier to edit.</p>
