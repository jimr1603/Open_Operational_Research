This is an ongoing scratchpad of what I have ideas for, what I'm working on, and what I just need to make presetnable. There's a massive difference between code I'm happy gives me an answer, and code I'm happy for someone else to see.

| Ideas | Working | Pretty | Housekeeping | 
|-------|------|---------|--------| 
|   traing neural nets| Gov Organogram data |   Graph theory on road networks and train networks  |   Choose a theme  | 
|  Wikidata queries  |   |    |  Buy a domain name  | 
|    importing Google Charts  |     |       |     Add CV/publication history | 
| File size to weight in books conversion | | | Bibliography master file|
| | | | All data used in one place|

This was originally going to be a Trello. I'm probably going to need something that needs less maintainance than a raw markup file, probably something with vectors.
