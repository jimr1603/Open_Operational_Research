This is an ongoing scratchpad of what I have ideas for, what I'm working on, and what I just need to make presetnable. There's a massive difference between code I'm happy gives me an answer, and code I'm happy for someone else to see.
```{r }
Ideas = c("training neural nets", "wikidata querires", "importing Google charts", ""filesize to book equivalent")
Working = c()
Pretty = c("graph theory on road and train networks")
Housekeeping = c("Choose a theme", "buy a domain name", "Add CV/publications", "Include bibliography")

```


This was originally going to be a Trello. I'm probably going to need something that needs less maintainance than a raw markup file, probably something with vectors.
