      <title>Analysis on a plane</title>

      <description>Background I’m on a plane! No-frills airlines don’t have wifi, so I’ve downloaded a bunch of datasets and a bunch of libraries and seen if I can do a bit of analysis while in the air. Yes, yes, I can.
I thought this would be a part 2, but it turns out I never published part 1.
Again, this is personal data - you don’t get to see exactly what books are in my library.</description>

      <title>May Day special - union membership UK</title>

      <description>I know May Day/International Workers Day is May 1. To actually have time to write this I needed the bank holiday.
BEIS have some nice statistics on union membership since 1882, and actually, they’ve applied most of the functions to them I find interesting. So most of this is going to be about presentation of data, and maybe adding some context to data.</description>

      <title>Life &amp; Death part 3</title>

      <description>Background From before I hit publish on part 2, I had people telling me that the graphs were cool and they wanted their version. I briefly considered making a page with 404 graphs on it - 2 graphs \(*\) 2 sexes \(*\) 101 age groups. Then I remembered that this is a webpage, not a static document, and Javascript is a thing. I discovered the rather useful htmlwidget plotly, which adds interactivity and drops some of the painful aspects of ggplot.</description>

      <description>The story so far In part 1 we saw how you can estimate difficult probabilities with a large number of simulations. Every time I updated that post my poor home desktop took 10 mins to run the simulation. And it still wasn’t good enough. Also, it doesn’t scale. 10 minutes times 100 ages times 2 sexes = NO.
 Probability Trees It is time to think smarter. When in doubt in probability with a small number of outcomes, I like to draw probability trees.</description>

      <description>Motivation As I just had another birthday with a ‘0’ at the end, I’m thinking about how long I have left.And it relates to other forecasts I could make, like will I ever pay off my student loans? The ONS publish national life tables under the OGL, so we have the data, and the permission to use it. And straight away I can see that the average UK 30-year old male has about 50 years left.</description>
