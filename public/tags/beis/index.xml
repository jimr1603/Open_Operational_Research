      <description>I know May Day/International Workers Day is May 1. To actually have time to write this I needed the bank holiday.
BEIS have some nice statistics on union membership since 1882, and actually, theyâ€™ve applied most of the functions to them I find interesting. So most of this is going to be about presentation of data, and maybe adding some context to data.</description>
