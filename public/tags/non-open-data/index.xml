      <description>Background I’m on a plane! No-frills airlines don’t have wifi, so I’ve downloaded a bunch of datasets and a bunch of libraries and seen if I can do a bit of analysis while in the air. Yes, yes, I can.
I thought this would be a part 2, but it turns out I never published part 1.
Again, this is personal data - you don’t get to see exactly what books are in my library.</description>

      <description>Note This post is analysis on data that I obtained freely - through GDPR, but you’re not getting access to. I’m not sharing my full playing history for the last 3 months with everyone who reads this!
Also, the long delay since last post is because I moved house. Picking this back up now.
 Background GDPR means that EU citizens are entitled to a copy of personal data that a company is holding on them.</description>
