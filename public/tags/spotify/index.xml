      <description>Note This post is analysis on data that I obtained freely - through GDPR, but you’re not getting access to. I’m not sharing my full playing history for the last 3 months with everyone who reads this!
Also, the long delay since last post is because I moved house. Picking this back up now.
 Background GDPR means that EU citizens are entitled to a copy of personal data that a company is holding on them.</description>
