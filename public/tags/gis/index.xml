      <description>Introducing the leaflet package Plain images of map data is so web 1.0. R htmlwidgets mean I don’t have to acttuully learn Javascript to mess around with Javascript libraries in this site. One of the flagship examples leaflet works with OSM out of the box.

      <description>Motivation I am a professional mathematician - coffee is essential to my wellbeing. Lunch is just about the right time of the day to want a 2nd coffee of the day, and get some fresh air and time not looking at the screen. Especially now that it’s not raining or snowing 100% of the time. Given a 60 minute lunch, what are my options? Does it become a massive pain if I decide I want a 30 minute lunch instead?</description>
