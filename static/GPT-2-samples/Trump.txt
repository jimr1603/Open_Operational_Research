Lightweight Angelina Jolie was a paid lobbyist for the very powerful Hillary Clinton, including employment. So idiotic!
Lightweight Republican Senator Joe Donnelly should be investigated for his extramarital affairs for which he resigned in disgrace!
Lightweight FBI Director Comey should resign for the fact that he failed to turn over his memos to Congress. He knew nothing!
President Obama likes former Gov. Bobby Kennedy, but Perez is an extra. Why doesn't he have a choice other than to walk away? What are you waiting for?
Doral has been rated ‚ÄúGood‚Äù for a number of reasons: luxury, California, its pristine coastline; top rated Resort, Midas Touch, provides an exceptional lifestyle.
I think T. Boone Pickens should start his Bob &amp; Brunner Racing course at Doral - after Doral to move them out. Modern courses are beautiful in adding street and countryside beauty
Why does Pres. Obama believe Bob and Brunner rip each other off when they move Doral, while they get lots of free gear from Ocean City? They are great resorts!
I want a rule of thumb on whether or not you should rip someone off at the point of a gun, and whether to permanently remove the weapon--a major match made in court.

#ICYMI - The GOP is claiming that Crooked Hillary is unfairly treated-- yet they find the media totally unfair.BIG MONEY, BIG LEADERSHIP!
The Democrat Establishment leaders refused for months to include Crooked Hillary in the DATA report. Only now they are threatening to take it down so that others may use it!
Wow, Crooked Hillary's decision making ability was so terrible that she jeopardized the integrity of the Intelligence Community and our great democracy. An Economy where wealth and power is concentrated at the top!
Crooked Hillary's deal with Schumer &amp; Pelosi is an Envy to our Country and our values--- it isn't working! The party will be voting for her!

We have created more than 27,000 new jobs with the signing of the United States Currency Bill today. ...We go out of our buildings, through massive windmills, to invest in plants that have become obsolete. We keep our factories and plants open, but close at all hours while others close. It is a great day for New York!
Fiscal Year 2017 now in full swing. WE will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Be sure to read this story of an anachronistic decision made by the Department of Justice that deprived a judge of a telephonic argument. This was not my decision, it is the result of the courts but the courts don‚Äôt know what the Court believes!
The White House was briefed in advance of really significant Infrastructure Bill votes. We thanked our brilliant, future First Responders for their kind advice on today‚Äôs vote. We made a point of letting others vote and enrolled because that‚Äôs how it is done. There are many good reasons not to do so, but only one reason entirely!
The Democrats‚Äô Infrastructure Bill passed 98-0 with Democrats not voting. The House Republicans did not not include. Democrats should get rid of the Bill and go to the Senate‚Äôs regularly scheduled actions. They are laughing at the ridiculous vote times and honing their talent. Get rid of the failed Infrastructure Bill now. Move Fast &amp; Finance!
Timing of votes is determined by the number of votes needed to pass Bill Mustellum, Vice Chair of the House Budget Committee. Number benefits would have been twice as much even if Bill was NOTRE DIFFERENT. Where‚Äôs the outrage?‚Äù  Bill benefits ‚Äúworkers‚Äù and ‚Äúcontributions_ less than 2% of House‚Äù expected economy. Bill has been a disaster for the GOP!
Remember as we stand with our great Wild Bill supporters on Wednesday night in Albany, NY against all ‚Äúbill supporters and blindies who voted for Bill now,‚Äù all three parties will do the right thing, vote out the Dems, RE

If you expose someone because of their economic situation your conduct towards them will be considered a level of dishonor. An example of that is by reporting on "hot skin" industries - people don't like officials.

Crooked Hillary Clinton made a TOTAL VICTIM!
I watched the Donald Trump vs Crooked Hillary D minor release last night. It was a total lie so bad I had to tune in--we had a great debate!
Working closely with the Clinton team, I was planning her attack on DACA after being demeaned by her supporters as if she was a "moderate voter." Now called Iran!
Was hosted by all of the major news organizations throughout the day discussing policy, the real pro-growth policies and also popular vote.
‚ÄúTrump is a fully fledged Senator. This is why he has the leverage and stamina necessary to win.‚Äù Mike Jenkins
Wow, @foxandfriends is doing a big ratings hit after so much talk. Thank you for your support by updating people @800News will get one in 10 people to tune in. Big campaign promise, great ratings!
‚ÄúWhile this election is about whether or not we can bring back our economy and our freedoms, more than 500,000 Americans say they‚Äôve voted for Trump.‚Äù @FoxNews
Crooked Hillary gave birth to essentially identical ‚ÄòMumps‚Äô baby boxes in this same manner. Made false claim about me and I was never in touch. Has enemies all over, sources fudging news. Give her credit!
Weak and indelicate ‚Äúspecial interests‚Äù want to control what scientists can contribute to public opinion and whether we want to hear it. @piersmorgan has done a FANTASTIC job!
Horrible that Crooked Hillary is jealous of our tax dollars and how much our Country taxes are going to the top 1% when they‚Äôre all paying a moral price. This is going to RESULT IN A REBELLINESS!
Wish she was elected public speaker and that she would put our beautiful and very talented First Lady deep into the voting booth and talk about a "trump ticket"! No fun in Paris, France!
What  @seanhannity  did to justify all of the "congratulations" over her very long &amp; boring Piers Morgan Interview. HE BROKE HER IN THE FACE! I wish she had the courtesy to respond to Romney

Thank you, Country. Armed Forces One, two and three are all set to be relentless. Leading the charge will be Army Gen. McChrystal, who is smart as a tack. Very dangerous, but commanders keep talking. Fire on ISIS and other fronts. Democrats want to remain silent. GO HOME
Phoenix Sheriff Joe Arpaio explained why he believes there is "absolutely no truth" in the rumor that Crooked Hillary paid more lawyers and now lies while he is in office! That claim is exposed. BSD badly needs Sheriff Joe ASAP! Speed this ship up!
Incredible job in the United States Air Force. I‚Äôm watching the other side very negative now. Our air traffic control is a joke. A corrupt system which makes it easier for Iran to cheat the USA on its nuclear programs. Sorry, we are going to rebuild our military, no questions asked!
I love Arizona! I get all of our news from our website and for that reason, I‚Äôm keeping an open door to the American people. If you have a request, please come in and get it. Our fantastic people will do a great job. Make the drive!
The District of Columbia is a very special place. I‚Äôd like to see Republicans try to fill the very small holes and fill the top of our mountains with green on those who don‚Äôt want to see us do it right or legally. Our debt has grown over 20 times our GDP, and our taxes have just increased - 50% on average. Dems do not get what they want. Turn our country around!
California‚Äôs gas tax is too high - why can‚Äôt they charge the same amount of Montana‚Äôs while Amazon sells its products here in the U.S. Our country would be very rich in trade if they moved there and sold more products there. Borrower taxes should be far lower in California. Congress must not allow this to happen.
.@PeteRose_21 said that perhaps the young ones from Macomb County should only have the permits issued. The job numbers are incredible. The young farmers are left with nothing, except despair and sadness. Michigan and other states are no longer dependent on the U.S. What did the U.S. do wrong? What do we need to do differently now.
Attending a Tour of the White House last week was a great success, there was also laughter throughout the country, and great discussions on the very pressing much for a no-JCPOA situation. I look forward to our very fair and very generous terms and enjoy permitting them. Border, Military & other things will be greatly improved.

Spent the day on Monday visiting Flat Earth Theory [it's an incorrect fact] as a Special Congressional Delegate. I look forward to voting for those who know how to make great policies. Without my leadership the Dems would never have control of our fate. Terrible for Republican Congressional Campaign -- terrible!
Our country is in chaos as a consequence of the Fake News Media. Look at our Country and how poorly our legal system is doing. Agreed with Dems when they talked up Billions of dollars but have no morals or respect for others
Gov. Scott Walker will be our next President. I must say Fischer had a great time at his discussion in Tampa. You will see in the end results we are where we should be‚Äîwe have a Donald Trump Administration to realize the very best for our government!

RICHMOND, CA (May 6, 2013)‚ÄîBy passing 60 million votes on Election Day, President Obama is now ceding all Super Pacs and handing over to non-controllers: http://t.co/NxtltekxKV Thanks to the sheer strength of our Establishment, corrupted politicians, we will NEVER LET OUR COUNTRY FOOL!
We accumulated more Super Pacs than the Republican Congress combined, and now have over 10 million. Many are at the LOWEST LEVELS of ANY PARTICULAR POLITICIAN! They should be SET FREE. If I win in the Fall, we will end this, and our Country will use them like never before! Too bad!
President Obama has explained so publicly how fraudulent our Election Numbers are and why they have come to be used for Pay to Play. He is telling the American Voter that AFTER ELECTION, THEY WILL PUNISH A CONSERVATIVE AND STRONG ACT. NOTHING IS WORSE!

...most of the world has the right to know what really happened on 9/11/01. We don't have a good &amp; beautiful legacy, terrible failures, and large swaths never recovered. Just another disgrace!
The horrible events there have been so deadly. The NYC Governor, even some from local leaders, have not been in a position to fully heal the shattered relationship! Nor can we continue to have our great law enforcement officers. PAY TRILLIES
Congratulations to defeated Vermont Senator Viscount S. Whyte (a man who doesn't belong on my TV justice / people's republic) for successfully attacking the Democrats! Judd promised more economic stimulus. Very unfair!
Why is Rep. Keith Ellison (of the great people of Burlington) the only person running for President that has not worked for 47% of the vote, the Democrats!
The News Service of the World (S.W.O.) just stated that I, in fact, have not stopped acting on the 9/11/01 Energy Rally. As usual, they are true reporters. Dishonest reporting is evil!

I am the only one who has the guts to tell the truth, often without being asked about it, in a campaign. The fact is we have much more to hide than just talking. Now Obama must finally come clean!

The Zimmerman trial is UNFAIR. Yesterday almost all of Zimmerman‚Äôs lawyers said they could see through Walls/Stairs. Perhaps by Wednesday, because Zimmerman lost Wednesday for good.

Congratulations to the Queens of NY and the entire @Broncos family on a strong season. The NFL is proud to have Drew Brees as the co-winner. Although he did not have a great game in New York, he was as good as advertised. Really good, thanks Rob!

Everybody is wasting time and money with reality TV shows and movies that are scripted to be politically correct. Nothing is 100% true!
Alan Dershowitz is right, Americans really needed a leadership change in response to constantly beating themselves up over funding of the government. Shows used as propaganda, then destroyed when Dershowitz came along. MOVEMENT!
A great day in Tampa. Again, great leaders and civic participation. Disappointed in Michelle and not one of the leaders knows what she is talking about - No 'movement' - silent. Dershowitz is right, Americans REALLY needed more leadership.
The thought process of a big negotiations about the LIBERATION AND Absolute Success of the United States was dispelled. We will keep doing what we are doing and rebuilding our economy. Jobs are coming back, trade has more prestige, universities are attracting more people. No 'Movement'
We could have a nice and peaceful election in November if we were treated fairly and if Americans felt they were treated fairly, both parties know how unfair all the media is! Be cool!
Thank you Tampa, Florida. See you tomorrow. These are great people and, sadly, there is not much we can do. We are getting ready to move forward on a tremendous campaign. We love our country and will always have it. Honor these veterans!

China is buying others in economics &amp; finance, as China did with The Fed. Is China really so stupid or is it just a marketing ploy to gain market share?

Great job @LegSteny! @dcflowen The country in turmoil is imploding with our illegal immigrants here in our country. Only our President can fix the mess! Votes 4!
If we keep illegal immigrants from coming into our country, they will instantly become very dangerous. Many are, according to my estimates, "looking to commit crimes undetected." We have to put the safety of the American People first
Congress should not take any chances w/ illegal immigrant families moving across the border! Immigrants, as an example, are 3.6% of the population. Border situation, very tough future. STAY!
I think it is time for Congress to ACT, or get this mess quasi-legal!

The Dallas shootings are emblematic of the final days of Sandy.
Democracy means Democracy for America! Now is their time ‚Äì fast!
Sandy made our hearts break. These horrible incidents are a stain on our country.
Death throes, however, are not the hardships of the first Allied attack on Japan, but the Allied victories, in World War II, who ultimately terminated that war?
.@Late_Show MSNBC is falling apart fast!
Why did the U.S. pay for the mother of Sandy victims, 212 lives, with little or no retribution? She had NO HOPE for America. Outrageous!
What waste of lives and money, if any, can be saved by investing in Windor Wind turbines in SC or NE?
‚ÄúWind turbines have proven to be the single greatest source of counter-cyclical and counter-insurmountable carbon emissions in the world.‚Äù -- Mark Towson, Windpower expert
Wind turbines will destroy wildlife, create tremendous difficulties for local farmers, and strain tremendous amounts of Earth's energy. @marcorubio
Our National Security Advisor was interviewed by a ‚Äúhorrible joke‚Äù‚ÄîJoe Theismann totally overrated and poorly thought-out. Thank you Joe.
Mar-a-Lago, one of the great clubs in the world, is receiving many requests to open a new Trump Home Place with its own course. Dominated.
I loved the Dallas shooting. Go out and vote and I‚Äôm right. Then again, all the politicians do is talk better.
Mexico must be careful about what they sell us.They should be covering our border better. They must respect our laws. Unfortunately, we are getting caught in the middle of them.
California loves Republicans, ultra-conservative Christians and the  same old Schumer/Sessions-as will the Democrats. They are the party of good and of recovery.
Jay Z then became a movie star--yawn to me. When I left, he was only in the greats--bad. Fortunately, I had a great time at his birthday party. Jay Z is a winner!

Oil prices are up over $100 because global markets are working themselves out of order. On the global stage the Russian missile crisis makes U.S. leadership look foolish. @BarackObama is not looking forward to the end of Obama. All talk and no action. Unless it's a wise choice!
Since my election victory, anti-Pence T.Q. has gained a disproportionately small following among Hispanics &amp; African-Americans. Including Dems Despite Obamaulling!
Cadillac released the Cadillac "Queen" @Cafanze- was used in Trump Tower and during his twitter stop in September. Cadillac said Cadillac---managers are too stupid to play (the company owns the thing). Cadillac-won - We are going to keep them and win. Cadillac must be held accountable!
Great meeting with CEOs of airlines, workers and state and local leaders. We can't have another Barry Switzer in office. Many airlines are losing customers &amp; businesses. We will also know long-term impact before the Dec.21 rollover.

I nominated my son Jared yesterday for the Department of @POTUS. He has been a tremendous success for the United States and the United States will not be idly waiting for results. He will take our Country to the next level and achieve it within the DAY!

The U.S.

Bills are NOTOLCHES in the middle of summer - what a waste of time &amp; money!
Finally, Russia is behaving much more like the U.S. than it did 1 year ago. Placing greater sanctions on various Chinese companies during U.N. negotiations. BILLION IN HONORS, &amp; MILLIONS!

Washington is laughing at Iran. Over 2,000 aircraft flying at anchor and talking about a possible strike. The Commander-in-Chief (COP) told peacehalls not to kill, but would lock them down. Very un-American!
ISIS has declared the airplane even though it belongs in Iraqi airspace to be a terrorist organization. They can‚Äôt fly over our air space. Why would they fly over our air space? They only fly if we agree to disagree on surveillance. Preval U.S. record!
Taxi drivers at the border point out that @RNC speaker of the House, @JonTapper, is their son. Really bad, Jon. Low ratings at best. Unfortunate!

The #NAM should act immediately to get the fast movement of hard drugs out of our country fast &amp; to shut our river crossings. Stop them today &amp; bring them home fast.
The stupidity and illegitimacy of this # immigration bill is absolutely ridiculous - pundits take for granted how appointments are handled.

Why are these NATO members withdrawing while Russia is increasing their troops or sending them home? Now are warmongers!
One of the questioners said where the Iraq War was going (despite the Chechnya war and us not happening). NATO, no longer a good strength!
Why isn't the Obama Administration looking at how to pay our veterans more and better (by ObamaCare) and far more (by new CHOICE plans, simplification) all wasteful?

President Obama strongly opposes NATO membership, which would keep many of our NATO allies out. This has got to change!
The White House and Senate should be focused on very serious funding of mental health care and addiction treatment. Why doesn't the DNC?
Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein will be incompetent. The Democrats are pushing this very dangerous path in the White House. Bad!
Hypocrite. That Office (of Legal Counsel) is the subject of strong and persistent lawsuit. This is a total fraud!

We don't have President Obama ‚Äì he isn't "the President." He is the "chief executive" ‚Äì run for him!
Funny, but the DNC says the FBI is watching the lawsuit and is not going after the only person who could be hurt. Unbelievable!
The Democrats know how to win a general election with so little common sense on certain issues. This could happen.The Democrats face total defeat!
The worst thing Donald Trump could do in office, and should, is create an unemployment insurance policy. How sad!
The fact is Hillary ("playboater") Clinton came in second in the Democratic primary, barely covered by the fine people of New Hampshire. If I win she will never get a majority!
