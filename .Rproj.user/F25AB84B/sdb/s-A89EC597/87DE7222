There's a massive difference between code I'm happy gives me an answer, and code I'm happy for someone else to see. \n```{r  echo=FALSE}\nIdeas = c(\"training neural nets\", \"wikidata querires\", \"importing Google charts\", \"filesize to book equivalent\", \"background: graph theory\", \"background:spherical coordinates\", \"background:xml\")\nWorking = c(\"Making table of workflow\", \"Open Organograms\")\nPretty = c(\"graph theory on road and train networks\")\nHousekeeping = c(\"Add CV/publications\", \"Include bibliography\", \"Shortcodes\", \"Tag posts with GORS compitencies\")\n\nn_max=max(length(Ideas), length(Working), length(Pretty), length(Housekeeping))\n\npad_column <- function(column, n_max){\n  return(c(column,rep(\"\",n_max-length(column))))\n}\nIdeas = pad_column(Ideas,n_max)\nWorking=pad_column(Working,n_max)\nPrettify = pad_column(Pretty, n_max)\nHousekeeping=pad_column(Housekeeping,n_max) \nt<-tibble(Ideas,Working, Prettify, Housekeeping)\nkable(t)\n```\n\nThis was originally going to be a Trello. I'm probably going to need something that needs less maintenance than a raw markup file, probably something with vectors.\n\nNow there's a mildly ugly code in the background making a tibble with blanks. But at least it's easier to edit. ",
